# TODO

## ðŸ“‹ To Do

- [ ] Try using [HTML to Image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image) instead of using captureTab(),
since this requires <all_urls> on FireFox for no good reason ([source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/captureTab)). If I use HTML to Image, maybe I'll
be able to restrict the extension to just requiring host permissions for the specific Bear Tracks websites. Maybe add a background.html page
and embed an HTML to Image cdn there so that I can use it easily? (this item might deserve a separate branch)

## ðŸ›  In Progress

## âœ” Done
- [x] Properly attribute UI icons (see https://github.com/google/material-design-icons, at the bottom of the README)
- [x] Make copy button work
